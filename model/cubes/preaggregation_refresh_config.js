/**
 * Performance Optimization Recommendations
 * 
 * 1. INCREMENTAL REFRESH PATTERNS:
 *    - Use incremental refresh for high-frequency updates (< 1 hour)
 *    - Set appropriate updateWindow based on data volatility
 *    - Smaller updateWindow = faster refresh, larger = more comprehensive
 * 
 * 2. PARTITION STRATEGIES:
 *    - Daily data: partition by month
 *    - Monthly data: partition by quarter or year
 *    - Real-time: partition by day or week
 * 
 * 3. INDEX OPTIMIZATION:
 *    - Primary index on company_id + time dimension
 *    - Secondary indexes on frequently filtered dimensions
 *    - Avoid over-indexing (max 3-4 indexes per pre-aggregation)
 * 
 * 4. STORAGE OPTIMIZATION:
 *    - Use external: false for frequently accessed data
 *    - Enable compression for large historical pre-aggregations
 *    - Regular cleanup of unused pre-aggregations
 * 
 * 5. REFRESH TIMING:
 *    - Stagger refresh times to avoid resource contention
 *    - Use cron expressions for precise scheduling
 *    - Consider timezone for global deployments
 * 
 * 6. MONITORING REQUIREMENTS:
 *    - Track refresh duration trends
 *    - Monitor storage growth
 *    - Alert on refresh failures
 *    - Track query performance improvements
 * 
 * 7. RESOURCE ALLOCATION:
 *    - Real-time: High CPU, moderate memory
 *    - Batch processing: High memory, moderate CPU
 *    - Historical: High storage, low CPU/memory
 * 
 * 8. FAILOVER STRATEGIES:
 *    - Implement refresh retries with exponential backoff
 *    - Maintain fallback to raw queries for critical data
 *    - Use read replicas for pre-aggregation builds
 * 
 * 9. DATA FRESHNESS SLA:
 *    - Real-time dashboards: < 5 minutes
 *    - Operational reports: < 1 hour
 *    - Management reports: < 4 hours
 *    - Historical analysis: < 24 hours
 * 
 * 10. COST OPTIMIZATION:
 *     - Use spot instances for batch refreshes
 *     - Implement data lifecycle policies
 *     - Archive old pre-aggregations to cold storage
 *     - Use query-based refresh triggers for low-traffic data
