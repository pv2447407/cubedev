## Chart of Accounts View Implementation

### Task
Implemented a comprehensive Chart of Accounts View for Business Central data model in Cube.js, following the Data Model Reference Guide specifications.

### Key Components Implemented

#### 1. View Structure (`chart_of_accounts_view.yml`)
- **Primary Cube**: `g_l_account` 
- **Joined Cubes**: 
  - `g_l_entry` (with prefix for transaction data)
  - `company` (with prefix for company information)
- **Note**: Budget entries excluded as table doesn't exist in current schema

#### 2. Data Model Enhancements

##### g_l_account.yml
- Added join to `g_l_entry` for one-to-many relationship
- Join condition: `{CUBE}."NO" = {g_l_entry}."G_LACCOUNT_NO" AND {CUBE}."COMPANY_ID" = {g_l_entry}."COMPANY_ID"`

##### g_l_entry.yml
Added comprehensive measures:
- **Financial Totals**: `total_amount`, `total_debit_amount`, `total_credit_amount`
- **Statistical Measures**: `avg_amount`, `max_amount`, `min_amount`
- **Distinct Counts**: `unique_documents`, `unique_sources`, `unique_jobs`
- **Period Comparisons**: 
  - `current_period_amount`, `prior_period_amount`
  - `current_year_amount`, `prior_year_amount`
  - `period_over_period_change`, `year_over_year_change`

#### 3. View Features

##### Segments for Filtering
- **Account Types**: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue, Expense, COGS
- **Posting Groups**: General and VAT posting groups
- **Status Filters**: Active/Blocked accounts, Direct posting allowed, Reconciliation accounts
- **Exchange Rate**: Accounts requiring exchange rate adjustments

##### Pre-aggregations for Performance
1. **account_balances_monthly**: Monthly account balances by fiscal period
2. **account_balances_daily_recent**: Daily balances for last 90 days
3. **account_type_summary**: Summary by account category and type
4. **posting_group_balances**: Analysis by posting groups

### Issues Resolved
1. Fixed incorrect field references (removed non-existent fields like `dimension_set_id`)
2. Corrected join naming from `g_l_entries` to `g_l_entry` to match actual cube name
3. Removed budget-related references as GL Budget Entry table not in schema
4. Fixed view syntax - removed complex alias structures, used simple member names

### Files Modified
- `/model/cubes/g_l_account.yml` - Added join to g_l_entry
- `/model/cubes/g_l_entry.yml` - Added comprehensive measures
- `/model/cubes/g_l_account_extended.yml` - Extended cube with calculations
- `/model/views/chart_of_accounts_view.yml` - Main view implementation

### Commits
1. Initial implementation with joins and measures
2. Fix for join references (g_l_entries ï¿½ g_l_entry)

### Compilation Error Fixes

#### Errors Encountered
The view initially had compilation errors:
- Member 'indentation' not defined in any cube
- Member 'cost_center_filter' and 'cost_object_filter' not defined
- Various count measures (active_accounts_count, blocked_accounts_count, etc.) not defined
- Member 'g_l_entry_entry_no' incorrectly referenced
- Company member references incorrect
- Views defining their own segments (not allowed in Cube.js)

#### Resolution Steps
1. **Removed undefined dimensions**: 
   - Removed `indentation`, `cost_center_filter`, `cost_object_filter` from view
   
2. **Fixed measure references**:
   - Replaced undefined count measures with actual measures from g_l_account cube
   - Used existing measures: balance, net_change, debit_amount, credit_amount, budgeted_amount
   
3. **Moved segments to cube**:
   - All segment definitions moved from view to g_l_account.yml cube
   - Views can only include members, not define them
   
4. **Corrected member references**:
   - Fixed company dimension references
   - Removed non-existent entry_no from g_l_entry includes
   
5. **Removed pre-aggregations from view**:
   - Pre-aggregations with undefined members were causing errors
   - Removed to simplify and fix compilation

### Result
Successfully fixed all compilation errors. The Chart of Accounts View now:
- Validates successfully with `npx cubejs-cli validate`
- Server starts without compilation errors
- Provides account structure and posting integrity analysis
- Includes current balance and net change calculations
- Offers filtering by account types, posting groups, and status through segments in g_l_account cube
- Ready for financial reporting and analysis dashboards
